# NOTES:

## Updates:
- Add on a second `BufferExample`, which will call a file `loremipsum.txt` and read it through a FileStream w/ BufferedStream
- Seperate each example into a different .cs file (`StackExample.cs`, `HeapExample.cs`, `BufferDemonstration.cs`, `BufferExample.cs`)"

## Questions/Suggestions/Thoughts:
- Rename GitHub repository to something more fitting?
